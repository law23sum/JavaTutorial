Java Mini Project: Library Management System (LMS)
Concept
A small Spring Boot web application to manage a library of books, readers, and borrow/return operations. This single project will let you practice frameworks, patterns, OOP principles, core Java libraries, and deployment flow — all in one place.

🔑 Features to Implement
1. Core Foundations (Java basics)
* Define Book, Author, Reader classes with attributes (int id, String name, etc).
* Use control flow for availability checks (if-else, switch).
* Store collections of books in an ArrayList or HashMap.
2. OOP Principles
* Inheritance: User → subclasses Reader, Librarian.
* Encapsulation: private fields + getters/setters for Book.
* Polymorphism: Interface Borrowable with methods borrow(), returnItem().
* Composition: Library has a collection of Book objects.
* Abstraction: Abstract class Item (extended by Book, Magazine).
3. Design Patterns
* Singleton: DatabaseConnection (mock, or real JDBC).
* Factory: Create Item objects (Books, Magazines).
* Builder: Fluent builder for creating complex Book objects.
* Method Chaining: For building queries or responses.
4. Core Libraries
* Collections API (HashMap for catalog, List for borrowed items).
* java.io/nio: Read/write borrowed book logs from a file.
* java.util.concurrent: Simulate multiple readers borrowing at once.
* java.net: Optionally fetch book info from an external API (mock with HttpClient).
5. Framework Layer (Spring Boot)
* REST API Endpoints:
    * GET /books → list all books
    * POST /books → add a book
    * POST /borrow/{id} → borrow a book
    * POST /return/{id} → return a book
* Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) → persist Book & Reader to a database (H2 for dev).
* Validation (annotations like @NotNull).
* Dependency Injection for services.
6. Testing & Quality
* JUnit + Mockito for unit tests:
    * BookServiceTest, LibraryControllerTest.
* Code coverage with JaCoCo.
7. Deployment & Integration
* Package with Gradle/Maven.
* Containerize with Docker.
* Deploy locally to Tomcat (WAR) or run standalone (Spring Boot JAR).
* CI/CD stub with GitHub Actions.

🌟 Why this project?
* It shows OOP principles (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, composition).
* Uses design patterns in real ways (Singleton, Factory, Builder).
* Integrates Java frameworks (Spring Boot, Hibernate).
* Practices libraries (collections, I/O, concurrency).
* Demonstrates workflow (build → test → deploy → containerize).
* Scales: can stay small, or expand into microservices with Kafka/RabbitMQ if you want to show off.

👉 Would you like me to outline step-by-step milestones (Week 1 → Week 2 → Week 3…) so you can build this project incrementally without burning out, or keep it as a flat checklist?
